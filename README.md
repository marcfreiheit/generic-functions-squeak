# Generic Messages (Squeak/Smalltalk) ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak.svg?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak?branch=master)
Generic Messages are an implementation of Generic Functions known from [CLOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System). They add support to dispatch a method on multiple parameters instead of a dispatch based on the receiver. 
They were implemented during the seminar _Programming Languages - Implementation and Design_ at the chair @hpi-swa-teaching at the HPI, Potsdam, Germany.

## Prerequisites
Make sure that you have [Metacello](https://github.com/dalehenrich/metacello-work) installed. 
## Setup
1. Clone this repo.
1. Open your Monticello Browser inside your Squeak
1. Add a _filetree_ repository to your package and select path: {repo_home}/packages
1. Load both _GenericFunctions-Core_, _GenericFunctions-Exceptions_ and _GenericFunctions-Tools_ (Other packages aren't important for running Generic Messages. They contain tests or courcs related stuff like a Gamada grammar)
1. You're ready to go!

## Getting Started
### Hello Generic Message
1. Create a new class
```Smalltalk
Object subclass: #DemoIntegerFive
	instanceVariableNames: ''
	classVariableNames: ''
	poolDictionaries: ''
	category: 'GenericFunctions-Demo'
```
2. Add a _numericValue_ message to your demo integer
```Smalltalk
numericValue

	^ 5
```
3. Add your first MultiMethod. We want to define the MultiMethod _#add:_ for a SmallInteger 
```Smalltalk
add: anInteger
	<MultiMethod>
	<parameter: #anInteger isKindOf: #SmallInteger>
	^ self numericValue + anInteger
```
4. Then we define a MultiMethod wich handles an incoming float by converting it first
```Smalltalk
add: aFloat
	<MultiMethod>
	<parameter: #anInteger isKindOf: #Float>
	^ self numericValue + aFloat asInteger
```
5. Let's try out! Open up a workspace and evaluate the following commands
```Smalltalk
DemoInteger new add: 10 "returns 15"
DemoInteger new add: 12.4 "returns 17"
DemoInteger new add: 'Do not work yet' "throws an error"
```
6. Add another class called _DemoFloat_ and add the following MultiMethod
```Smalltalk
numericValue

	^ 7.5
```
7. 
```Smalltalk
add: anInteger
	<MultiMethod>
	<parameter: #anInteger isKindOf: #SmallInteger>
	
	^ self numericValue + anInteger asFloat
```
8. That's it! You have implemented your first Generic Message with MultiMethods belonging to different classes. Feel free to explore the structure and inspect some elements like _DemoFloat_, _DemoInteger_, _GenericMessage uniqueInstance_, _(GenericMessage uniqueInstance) at: #add:_!

### Tooling
Generic Messages ship with their own system browser. Using that browser, called _GenericMessageBrowser_, you can browse, create and remove MultiMethods. You don't have to deal with creating GenericMessages or DiscriminatingMethods by hand.
![GenericMessageBrowser](https://github.com/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak/blob/master/resources/img/Tooling-GenericMessageBrowser.png)
This browser is mandatory to properly register and unregister Generic Messages and Discriminating Methods when creating MultiMethods. The default system browser doesn't have that functionality and will break your setup! 

## Scope
### What you can do
The following actions can be performed without taking the system into a non-consistent state:
* You can add MultiMethods by annotating them with `<MultiMethod>` pragma
* You can change existing MultiMethods
* You can specify parameters by providing a class symbol
* You can browse MultiMethods using the _GenericMessageBrowser_
* You can delete MultiMethods
* You can delete classes with MultiMethods
* You can use your Squeak like before. My code does not make any changes to existing code
### What you can't do
The following actions can't be performed, because they are not implemented or take the system into a non-consistent state:
* You can't file out classes with MultiMethods
* You can't use Generic Messages inside the default system browser. Please refer to the tooling section
* You can't change instance variables of a class already containing MultiMethods. Recompiling logic is currently missing
* MethodCombinations and Ranking during dispatch isn't implemented yet. Therefore, dispatch fails if multiple methods are applicable
* You can't specify the specializing parameter. Pragmas are mapped from the left to right parameters. In addition, you can't specify a MultiMethod without any specializer.

## Implementation
### How are MultiMethods, DiscriminatingMethods and Generic Messages are registered?
Generic Messages are saved in a global dictionary, more precise: Inside the _Smalltalk_ dictionary.
![Structure](https://github.com/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak/blob/master/resources/img/Project%20Presentation%20-%20Generic%20Messages.png)
Both DiscriminatingMethods and MultiMethods are stored beside CompiledMethods inside the methodDict of a class. DiscriminatingMethods have a 'normal' selector without any type annotations. They _catch_ the message send of a receiver. MultiMethods have a selectior with type annotations. CompiledMethods aren't affected. 
![Structure](https://github.com/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak/blob/master/resources/img/Project%20Presentation%20-%20Entrypoint_%20Discriminating%20Methods.png)
### How does the dispatch works? 
A sender sends a message to a class which belongs to a Generic Message. The message send is caught by the DiscriminatingMethod. The DiscriminatingMethod is now responsible for passing the arguments and the receiver to the GenericMessage, which will perform the dispatch.
The GenericMessage is checking against all of it's MultiMethods if they are applicable for this set of arguments. Applicable methods are ranked and most specific method gets invoked.
Generic Messages can be called directly, too. Then, there is no need for a DiscriminatingMethod.

### Testing
Unfortunately, you can't rely on my testbed anymore. Due to side effects and a bad performing VM I stopped programming regarding the TDD paradigm. Some tests should work. On the other hand, some tests cause side effects because they to clean the method dicts and global Generic Message dict. 
If you want to be safe, skip importing _GenericFunctions-Tests-*_.
