# Generic Messages (Squeak/Smalltalk) ![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak.svg?branch=master) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/marcfreiheit/generic-functions-squeak?branch=master)
Generic Messages are an implementation of Generic Functions known from [CLOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp_Object_System). They add support to dispatch a method on multiple parameters instead of a dispatch based on the receiver. 

## Getting Started
### Tooling
### When to use Generic Messages

## Implementation
### How does the dispatch works?
